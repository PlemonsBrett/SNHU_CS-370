**Given Code vs. Custom Implementation**

In this project, I was provided with [describe the starter code/framework you received - e.g., "a basic environment setup and skeleton structure for the agent class"]. The foundational elements included [list specific components].

The code I developed myself encompasses [describe your contributions]. This includes:

### Connection to Computer Science

**What Computer Scientists Do and Why It Matters**

Computer scientists solve complex problems by designing algorithms, building systems, and creating tools that improve how we interact with information and automate decision-making. In this project, I embodied this role by tackling the fundamental challenge of creating artificial intelligence that can learn from experience—a problem with far-reaching implications.

The work demonstrated here matters because reinforcement learning represents a paradigm shift from traditional programming. Instead of explicitly coding every decision, we create systems that learn optimal strategies through trial and error, mimicking how humans and animals learn. This has transformative applications in autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, financial trading, and countless other domains where intelligent decision-making under uncertainty is crucial.

**Approaching Problems as a Computer Scientist**

My approach to this pirate agent problem exemplified computational thinking:

1. **Decomposition**: I broke the complex navigation problem into smaller components—state representation, action selection, and reward optimization
2. **Pattern Recognition**: I identified that this was fundamentally a sequential decision-making problem suitable for reinforcement learning
3. **Abstraction**: I modeled the environment as a Markov Decision Process, abstracting away unnecessary details while preserving essential dynamics
4. **Algorithm Design**: I implemented and tuned a deep Q-learning algorithm, making systematic adjustments based on performance data

Throughout the process, I maintained a scientific mindset—forming hypotheses about hyperparameter effects, conducting controlled experiments, and drawing conclusions from empirical evidence. This iterative approach of hypothesis, implementation, testing, and refinement is central to how computer scientists tackle complex problems.

**Ethical Responsibilities**

Working with AI systems brings significant ethical considerations that I carefully considered:

**To End Users**:

- **Transparency**: I documented my approach clearly so users understand how the agent makes decisions
- **Fairness**: I ensured the agent's behavior doesn't exhibit harmful biases in its decision-making
- **Safety**: I implemented safeguards to prevent the agent from learning destructive behaviors

**To the Organization**:

- **Reliability**: I conducted thorough testing and validation to ensure the system performs as expected
- **Maintainability**: I wrote clean, well-documented code that others can understand and extend
- **Resource Responsibility**: I optimized the training process to use computational resources efficiently

**To Society**:

- **Beneficial AI**: I considered how the techniques demonstrated here could be applied to solve real-world problems
- **Education**: I structured this work to contribute to the broader understanding of AI capabilities and limitations

As AI systems become more prevalent, computer scientists bear the responsibility of ensuring these powerful tools are developed and deployed in ways that benefit humanity while minimizing potential harms.
